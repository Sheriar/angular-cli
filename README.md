# Spring Petclinic Angular [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/spring-petclinic/spring-petclinic-angular.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/spring-petclinic/spring-petclinic-angular/)

## Angular frontend for Spring Petclinic

Warning: **client only**. 
  Use REST API from backend [spring-petclinic-rest project](https://github.com/spring-petclinic/spring-petclinic-rest)
  You need start backend server before start frontend application.

## Screenshot

## Installation

1. Update angular-cli to latest version (8.0.3 current)
as described on [angular-cli github readme.md](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli#updating-angular-cli)

````
npm uninstall -g angular-cli @angular/cli
npm cache clean
npm install -g @angular/cli@latest
````
Clone project from github
````
git clone https://github.com/spring-petclinic/spring-petclinic-angular.git
````
Install local project package
````
npm install --save-dev @angular/cli@latest
if npm version > 5.0 delete package-lock.json file  ( bug in npm 5.0 - this file prevent correct packages install)
npm install
````

Now project use Angular CLI v.8.0.3 and Angular v.8.0.1
You can see current dependencies in [package.json](package.json) file.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.

## Documentation

The documentation of the Spring Petclinic Angular application is generated by the [compodoc](https://compodoc.app) tool.

Documentation URL: [https://spring-petclinic.github.io/spring-petclinic-angular/](https://spring-petclinic.github.io/spring-petclinic-angular/)

Regenerate the `docs` folder with [compodoc](https://compodoc.app):
```
compodoc -p src/tsconfig.app.json -d docs
```

## Deploy on Web servers

### Deploy on Nginx (for Nginx CentOS installation):

1. Build Angular application:

  ng build --prod --base-href=/petclinic/ --deploy-url=/petclinic/

2. Create sub-directory **/petclinic** in default nginx directory **/usr/share/nginx/html**

3. Copy **/dist**  sub-directory from Angular appication to  **/usr/share/nginx/html/petclinic**

4. Edit nginx config (nginx.conf file in /etc/nginx/ directory)

```
server {
	listen       80 default_server;
        root         /usr/share/nginx/html;
        index index.html;

	location /petclinic/ {
                alias /usr/share/nginx/html/petclinic/dist/;
                try_files $uri$args $uri$args/ /petclinic/index.html;
        }
}
```

5. Reload nginx:  **nginx -s reload**

6. Run app in brouser:  http://server_name/petclinic/

### Deploy on Apache (for Apache CentOS installation):

1. Build Angular application:

ng build --prod --base-href=/petclinic/ --deploy-url=/petclinic/

2. Create sub-directory **/petclinic** in default Apache directory **/var/www/html**

3. Go into Angular appication **/dist** sub-directory and copy all files and sub-dirs from it to **/var/www/html/petclinic**

4. Edit Apache config (/etc/https/conf/httpd.conf):

sudo vi /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf

Find the Directory /var/www/html> section and change the AllowOverride directive from None to All:
```
 /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf
 . . .
  <Directory /var/www/html>
 . . .
 # 
 # AllowOverride controls what directives may be placed in .htaccess files.
 # It can be "All", "None", or any combination of the keywords:
 # Options FileInfo AuthConfig Limit
 #
 AllowOverride All
 . . .
 </Directory>
 . . .
```
5. Save and exit the file and then restart Apache to apply the change:

sudo systemctl restart httpd

6. Create a .htaccess file in the directory **/var/www/html/petclinic**

sudo vi /var/www/html/petclinic/.htaccess

Add the following line to the top of the file to activate the RewriteEngine, which instructs Apache to process any rules that follow:
```
RewriteEngine On  
# If an existing asset or directory is requested go to it as it is
RewriteCond %{DOCUMENT_ROOT}%{REQUEST_URI} -f [OR]  
RewriteCond %{DOCUMENT_ROOT}%{REQUEST_URI} -d  
RewriteRule ^ - [L]

# If the requested resource doesn't exist, use index.html
RewriteRule ^ index.html  
```
7. Reload Apache:

sudo systemctl restart httpd

8. Run app in browser: http://server_name/petclinic/

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
Before running the tests make sure you are serving the app via `ng serve`.

## Further help

To get more help on the Angular CLI use `ng help` or go check out the [Angular CLI README](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/master/README.md).

## The Goal of Angular CLI

The Angular CLI creates, manages, builds and test your Angular projects. It's built on top of the
Angular DevKit.

## The Goal of DevKit

DevKit's goal is to provide a large set of libraries that can be used to manage, develop, deploy and
analyze your code.

# Getting Started - Local Development

## Installation

To get started locally, follow these instructions:

1. If you haven't done it already, [make a fork of this repo](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/fork).
1. Clone to your local computer using `git`.
1. Make sure that you have Node 10.13 or later installed. See instructions [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).
1. Make sure that you have `yarn` installed; see instructions [here](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install/).
1. Run `yarn` (no arguments) from the root of your clone of this project to install dependencies.

## Building and Installing the CLI

To make a local build:

```shell
yarn build --local
```

This generates a number of tarballs in the `dist/` directory. To actually use
the locally built tools, switch to another repository reproducing the specific
issue you want to fix (or just generate a local repo with `ng new`). Then
install the locally built packages:

```shell
cd "${EXAMPLE_ANGULAR_PROJECT_REPO}"
npm install -D ${CLI_REPO}/dist/*.tgz
```

Builds of this example project will use tooling created from the previous local
build and include any local changes. When using the CLI, it will automatically
check for a local install and use that if present. This means you can just run:

```shell
npm install -g @angular/cli
```

to get a global install of the latest CLI release. Then running any `ng` command
in the example project will automatically find and use the local build of the
CLI.

Note: If you are testing `ng update`, be aware that installing all the tarballs
will also update the framework (`@angular/core`) to the latest version. In this
case, simply install the CLI alone with
`npm install -D ${CLI_REPO}/dist/_angular_cli.tgz`, that way the rest of the
project remains to be upgraded with `ng update`.

## Debugging

To debug an invocation of the CLI, [build and install the CLI for an example
project](#building-and-installing-the-cli), then run the desired `ng` command
as:

```shell
node --inspect-brk node_modules/.bin/ng ...
```

This will trigger a breakpoint as the CLI starts up. You can connect to this
using the supported mechanisms for your IDE, but the simplest option is to open
Chrome to [chrome://inspect](chrome://inspect) and then click on the `inspect`
link for the `node_modules/.bin/ng` Node target.

Unfortunately, the CLI dynamically `require()`'s other files mid-execution, so
the debugger is not aware of all the source code files before hand. As a result,
it is tough to put breakpoints on files before the CLI loads them. The easiest
workaround is to use the `debugger;` statement to stop execution in the file you
are interested in, and then you should be able to step around and set breakpoints
as expected.

## Testing

There are three different test suites which can be run locally:

* Unit tests
  * Run: `yarn test --full`
  * Debug: `yarn debug:test --full`
* Large tests
  * Run: `yarn test-large --full`
  * Debug: `yarn debug:test-large --full`
* End to end tests
  * Run: `node tests/legacy-cli/run_e2e.js`
  * Run subset of tests: `node tests/legacy-cli/run_e2e.js tests/legacy-cli/e2e/tests/i18n/ivy-localize-*`

When running the debug commands, Node will stop and wait for a debugger to
attach. You can attach your IDE to the debugger to stop on breakpoints and step through the code. Also see [IDE Specific Usage](#ide-specific-usage) for a
simpler debug story.

When debugging a specific test, change `describe()` or `it()` to `fdescribe()`
and `fit()` to focus execution to just that one test. This will keep the output clean and speed up execution by not running irrelevant tests.

## IDE Specific Usage

Some additional tips for developing in specific IDEs.

### Intellij IDEA / WebStorm

To load the project in Intellij products, simply `Open` the repository folder.
Do **not** `Import Project`, because that will overwrite the existing
configuration.

Once opened, the editor should automatically detect run configurations in the
workspace. Use the drop down to choose which one to run and then click the `Run`
button to start it. When executing a debug target, make sure to click the
`Debug` icon to automatically attach the debugger (if you click `Run`, Node will
wait forever for a debugger to attach).

## Creating New Packages

Adding a package to this repository means running two separate commands:

1. `schematics devkit:package PACKAGE_NAME`. This will update the `.monorepo` file, and create the
  base files for the new package (package.json, src/index, etc).
1. `devkit-admin templates`. This will update the README and all other template files that might
  have changed when adding a new package.

For private packages, you will need to add a `"private": true` key to your package.json manually.
This will require re-running the template admin script.

# Packages
